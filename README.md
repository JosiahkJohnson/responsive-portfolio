# responsive-portfolio
The same website as last time, but this time using bootstrap to make a more screen-size responsive page.

# About me
This page was the first I worked on, and as such has been redone several times. The largest breakthrough I made was when I realized I could use the bootstrap grid layout for inside a container. This changed everything.

# Contact
This is page number 2, in my opinion it looks the best out of the three. Intrestingly enough, it was the first one I finished; aside from the header, not much work was done on it in the last few days.

# Portfolio
To be honest, this page isn't the one I'm most proud of, and if I had more time, I would probably do this one over again like I redid the about me page a few times. Still, this is where I figured out how I could efficiently use the grid pattern so it helped with the about me page.

# Some things I couldn't figure out
*The nav menu I figured out how to make it collapse into a button, but I could not make the button actually open the menu it was supposed to. The links work, but the collapsed menu would not open.

*Image alignment: I was able to get the main profile picture and the images to be more or less responsive, but some of them behave rather strange at smaller sizes. Especially some of the images on the Portfolio page. I suspect it has to do with the image inital shape/size.
